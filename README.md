# AWS Solutions Architect Labs
This repository is a modular collection of hands-on labs designed to progressively cover the concepts, patterns, and services required for the AWS Solutions Architect – Associate certification and for real-world backend/cloud engineering roles.

The goal of this repository is not a single project, but a structured learning and architecture journey, built through independent, evolutive technical labs.[README.md](aws-serverless-upload/README.md)
